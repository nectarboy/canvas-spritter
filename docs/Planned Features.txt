Roadmap:
[x] get Spritter to get something on screen
[x] be able to provide Spritter a list of objects to render each frame from JS land
[x] do the above every frame
[x] get a texture working
[x] different textures
[x] polygons
[x] fake perspective 2d sprite
[] different porter duff composite modes (for masking effects)
[] basic shaders like outlines?
[] circles / arcs
[] cleanup interface, make it good and easy to use
[] optimize / reduce data throughput
	- optimize vertex generation by cpu (its the main bottleneck, hurts when sprite count > 1000)
	- drawobjs using same vertex data? (maybe would be good for polygons with the same shape)
	- reduce data used / transported between shaders?
[] different draw calls for huge amounts of data (multiple tatlases) or smth

Planned Features:
* rendering textured quads (sprites) with rotation and scale
* rendering textured polygons
* object priority
* object scales (perspective) using z
* support for effects like texture displacement mapping, masking, texture moves and rotates unrelative to object, etc
* shaders applied to individual objects
* ability for sprite to use whats behind it? aka glass warping effects?
* load textures into big 2048x2048 texture atlases for less draw calls

What would be pretty cool and useful:
* checking if a sprite is visible on screen / obstructed
