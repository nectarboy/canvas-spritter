Setup time:

Draw whatever

Draw whatever to mask #x (x != 0) 

Specify masking for drawobjs with priority a to b


Draw time:

Assuming stencil is cleared, draw masking drawobjs (order doesn't matter) with stencil ref = x (always replace)

Draw drawobjs from 0 to a-1 normally

Draw drawobjs (opaques and transparents) from a to b with stencil ref = x (only draws if stencil value = x)

Draw drawobjs from a+1 to N normally
