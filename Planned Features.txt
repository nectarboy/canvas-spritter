Roadmap:
[x] get Spritter to get something on screen
[] be able to provide Spritter a list of objects to render each frame from JS land
[] do the above every frame
[] render quads of different colors given by JS
[] get textures working

Planned Features:
* rendering textured quads (sprites) with rotation and scale
* rendering textured polygons
* object priority
* object scales (perspective) using z
* support for effects like texture displacement mapping, masking, texture moves and rotates unrelative to object, etc
* shaders applied to individual objects
