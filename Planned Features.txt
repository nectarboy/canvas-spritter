Roadmap:
[x] get Spritter to get something on screen
[x] be able to provide Spritter a list of objects to render each frame from JS land
[x] do the above every frame
[x] get a texture working
[] different textures with different draw calls
[] polygons
[] basic shaders like outlines?
[] a good interface

Planned Features:
* rendering textured quads (sprites) with rotation and scale
* rendering textured polygons
* object priority
* object scales (perspective) using z
* support for effects like texture displacement mapping, masking, texture moves and rotates unrelative to object, etc
* shaders applied to individual objects
* ability for sprite to use whats behind it? aka glass warping effects?
* load textures into big 2048x2048 texture atlases for less draw calls
